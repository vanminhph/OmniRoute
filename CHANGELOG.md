## [1.0.7] — 2026-02-20

> ### 🐛 Bugfix Release — OpenAI Compatibility, Custom Models & OAuth UX
>
> Fixes three community-reported issues: stream default now follows OpenAI spec, custom OpenAI-compatible providers appear in `/v1/models`, and Google OAuth shows a clear error + tutorial for remote deployments.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`stream` defaults to `false`** — Aligns with the OpenAI specification which explicitly states `stream` defaults to `false`. Previously OmniRoute defaulted to `true`, causing SSE data to be returned instead of a JSON object, breaking clients like Spacebot, OpenCode, and standard Python/Rust/Go OpenAI SDKs that don't explicitly set `stream: true` ([#89](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/89))
- **Custom AI providers now appear in `/v1/models`** — OpenAI-compatible custom providers (e.g. FriendLI) whose provider ID wasn't in the built-in alias map were silently excluded from the models list even when active. Fixed by also checking the raw provider ID from the database against active connections ([#90](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/90))
- **OAuth `redirect_uri_mismatch` — improved UX for remote deployments** — Google OAuth providers (Antigravity, Gemini CLI) now always use `localhost` as redirect URI matching the registered credentials. Remote-access users see a targeted amber warning with a link to the new setup guide. The token exchange error message explains the root cause and guides users to configure their own credentials ([#91](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/91))

### 📖 Documentation

- **OAuth em Servidor Remoto tutorial** — New README section with step-by-step guide to configure custom Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 credentials for remote/VPS/Docker deployments
- **`.env.example` Google OAuth block** — Added prominent warning block explaining remote credential requirements with direct links to Google Cloud Console

## [1.0.6] — 2026-02-20

> ### ✨ Provider & Combo Toggles — Strict Model Filtering
>
> `/v1/models` now shows only models from providers with active connections. Combos and providers can be toggled on/off directly from the dashboard.

### ✨ New Features

- **Provider toggle on Providers page** — Enable/disable all connections for a provider directly from the main Providers list. Toggle is always visible, no hover needed
- **Combo enable/disable toggle** — Each combo on the Combos page now has a toggle. Disabled combos are excluded from `/v1/models`
- **OAuth private IP support** — Expanded localhost detection to include private/LAN IPs (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`) for correct OAuth redirect URIs

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`/v1/models` strict filtering** — Models are now shown only from providers with active, enabled connections. Previously, if no connections existed or all were disabled, all 378+ models were shown as a fallback
- **Disabled provider models hidden** — Toggling off a provider immediately removes its models from `/v1/models`

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-02-20

> ### 🐛 Hotfix — Model Filtering & Docker DATA_DIR
>
> Filters all model types in `/v1/models` by active providers and fixes Docker data directory mismatch.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`/v1/models` full filtering** — Embedding, image, rerank, audio, and moderation models are now filtered by active provider connections, matching chat model behavior. Providers like Together AI no longer appear without a configured API key (#88)
- **Docker `DATA_DIR`** — Added `ENV DATA_DIR=/app/data` to Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` ensuring the volume mount always matches the app data directory — prevents empty database on container recreation

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-02-19

> ### 🔧 Provider Filtering, OAuth Proxy Fix & Documentation
>
> Dashboard model filtering by active providers, provider enable/disable visual indicators, OAuth login fix for nginx reverse proxy, and LLM onboarding documentation.

### ✨ Features

- **API Models filtering** — `GET /api/models` now returns only models from active providers; use `?all=true` for all models (#85)
- **Provider disabled indicator** — Provider cards show ⏸ "Disabled" badge with reduced opacity when all connections are inactive (#85)
- **`llm.txt`** — Comprehensive LLM onboarding file with project overview, architecture, flows, and conventions (#84)
- **WhatsApp Community** — Added WhatsApp group link to README badges and Support section

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OAuth behind nginx** — Fixed OAuth login failing when behind a reverse proxy by using `window.location.origin` for redirect URI instead of hardcoded `localhost` (#86)
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` for OAuth** — Documented env var usage as redirect URI override for proxy deployments (#86)

## [1.0.3] — 2026-02-19

> ### 📊 Logs Dashboard & Real-Time Console Viewer
>
> Unified logs interface with real-time console log viewer, file-based logging via console interception, and server initialization improvements.

### ✨ Features

- **Logs Dashboard** — Consolidated 4-tab page at `/dashboard/logs` with Request Logs, Proxy Logs, Audit Logs, and Console tabs
- **Console Log Viewer** — Terminal-style real-time log viewer with color-coded log levels, auto-scroll, search/filtering, level filter, and 5-second polling
- **Console Interceptor** — Monkey-patches `console.log/info/warn/error/debug` at server start to capture all application output as JSON lines to `logs/application/app.log`
- **Log Rotation** — Size-based rotation and retention-based cleanup for log files

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Instrumentation consolidation** — Moved `initAuditLog()`, `cleanupExpiredLogs()`, and console interceptor initialization to Next.js `instrumentation.ts` (runs on both dev and prod server start)
- **Structured Logger file output** — `structuredLogger.ts` now also appends JSON log entries to the log file
- **Pino Logger fix** — Fixed broken mix of pino `transport` targets + manual `createWriteStream`; now uses `pino/file` transport targets exclusively with absolute paths

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-18

> ### 🔧 API Compatibility & SDK Hardening
>
> Response sanitization, role normalization, and structured output improvements for strict OpenAI SDK compatibility and cross-provider robustness.

### 🛡️ Response Sanitization (NEW)

- **Response sanitizer module** — New `responseSanitizer.ts` strips non-standard fields (`x_groq`, `usage_breakdown`, `service_tier`, etc.) from all OpenAI-format provider responses, fixing OpenAI Python SDK v1.83+ Pydantic validation failures that returned raw strings instead of parsed `ChatCompletion` objects
- **Streaming chunk sanitization** — Passthrough streaming mode now sanitizes each SSE chunk in real-time via `sanitizeStreamingChunk()`, ensuring strict `chat.completion.chunk` schema compliance
- **ID/Object/Usage normalization** — Ensures `id`, `object`, `created`, `model`, `choices`, and `usage` fields always exist with correct types
- **Usage field cleanup** — Strips non-standard usage sub-fields, keeps only `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and OpenAI detail fields

### 🧠 Think Tag Extraction (NEW)

- **`<think>` tag extraction** — Automatically extracts `<think>...</think>` blocks from thinking model responses (DeepSeek R1, Kimi K2 Thinking, etc.) into OpenAI's standard `reasoning_content` field
- **Streaming think-tag stripping** — Real-time `<think>` extraction in passthrough SSE stream, preventing JSON parsing errors in downstream tools
- **Preserves native reasoning** — Providers that already send `reasoning_content` natively (e.g., OpenAI o1) are not overwritten

### 🔄 Role Normalization (NEW)

- **`developer` → `system` conversion** — OpenAI's new `developer` role is automatically converted to `system` for all non-OpenAI providers (Claude, Gemini, Kiro, etc.)
- **`system` → `user` merging** — For models that reject the `system` role (GLM, ERNIE), system messages are intelligently merged into the first user message with clear delimiters
- **Model-aware normalization** — Uses model name prefix matching (`glm-*`, `ernie-*`) for compatibility decisions, avoiding hardcoded provider-level flags

### 📐 Structured Output for Gemini (NEW)

- **`response_format` → Gemini conversion** — OpenAI's `json_schema` structured output is now translated to Gemini's `responseMimeType` + `responseSchema` in the translator pipeline
- **`json_object` support** — `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` maps to Gemini's `application/json` MIME type
- **Schema cleanup** — Automatically removes unsupported JSON Schema keywords (`$schema`, `additionalProperties`) for Gemini compatibility
